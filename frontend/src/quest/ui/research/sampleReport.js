## Executive Summary

This strategic analysis presents a comprehensive program design framework for educational transformation across multiple government schools. The intervention focuses on systemic capacity building through teacher training, curriculum innovation, and stakeholder engagement.

## Key Research Findings

1. **Systemic Gap**: Current teacher training programs lack follow-up support, leading to only 15% retention of new pedagogical practices.
2. **Digital Divide**: While 80% of schools have hardware, only 30% have reliable internet connectivity, necessitating offline-first digital solutions.
3. **Community Trust**: Parental engagement is high (70%) in non-academic activities but low (20%) in academic governance, representing a major untapped resource.
4. **Policy Alignment**: The proposed intervention aligns perfectly with the new State Education Policy's focus on "experiential learning," unlocking potential government matching grants.
